#  **Purpose**
 
 This project were created with only one purpose - to practise _React Context API_
 in case of creating a calculator app. 
 Until now, I've never tried _React Hooks_ for managing state, so it was the first
 time.
 Also I decided to try using _TypeScript_. I know that's really tiny app, but as first experience it's quite interesting.
